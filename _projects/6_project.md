### High Level Idea
Researched and implemented different algorithms for translational, rotational, and curvature gains in Redirected Walking (C#, Unity, HTC Vive). Made environments using maze-generating algorithms to analyze the performance of the algorithms

### Note: 
This project was done as a part of the Final Year Major Project at Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhubhan University. The project demo, details and the codes will be uploaded soon!
