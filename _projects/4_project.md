### High Level Idea
We developed a deep learning model that aims to differentiate Typically Developing children from children suffering from Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The children play a game where multimodal information (gaze and touch) of the children is tracked. The deep learning model analyzes the multimodal information to identify the children with ASD.
