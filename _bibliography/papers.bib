abstract = {Evidential deep learning, built upon belief theory and subjective logic, offers a principled and computationally efficient way to turn a deterministic neural network uncertainty-aware. The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

title = {Deep Temporal Sets with Evidential Reinforced Attentions for Unique Behavioral Pattern Discovery},
year = {2023},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Machine learning-driven human behavior analysis is gaining attention in behavioral/mental health-care, due to its potential to identify behavioral patterns that cannot be recognized by traditional assessments. Real-life applications, such as digital behavioral biomarker identification, often require the discovery of complex spatiotemporal patterns in multimodal data, which is largely under-explored. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model that integrates uniquely designed Deep Temporal Sets (DTS) with Evidential Reinforced Attentions (ERA). DTS captures complex temporal relationships in the input and generates a set-based representation, while ERA captures the policy network's uncertainty and conducts evidence-aware exploration to locate attentive regions in behavioral data. Using child-computer interaction data as a testing platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DTS-ERA in differentiating children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and typically developing children based on sequential multimodal visual and touch behaviors. Comparisons with baseline methods show that our model achieves superior performance and has the potential to provide objective, quantitative, and precise analysis of complex human behaviors.},

abstract = {The Conditional Neural Process (CNP) family of models offer a promising direction to tackle few-shot problems by achieving better scalability and competitive predictive performance. However, the current CNP models only capture the overall uncertainty for the prediction made on a target data point. They lack a systematic fine-grained quantification on the distinct sources of uncertainty that are essential for model training and decision-making under the few-shot setting. We propose Evidential Conditional Neural Processes (ECNP), which replace the standard Gaussian distribution used by CNP with a much richer hierarchical Bayesian structure through evidential learning to achieve epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. The evidential hierarchical structure also leads to a theoretically justified robustness over noisy training tasks. Theoretical analysis on the proposed ECNP establishes the relationship with CNP while offering deeper insights on the roles of the evidential parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in various few-shot settings.},

    title     = {Multidimensional Belief Quantification for Label-Efficient Meta-Learning},
    abstract = {Optimization-based meta-learning offers a promising direction for few-shot learning that is essential for many real-world computer vision applications. However, learning from few samples introduces uncertainty, and quantifying model confidence for few-shot predictions is essential for many critical domains. Furthermore, few-shot tasks used in meta training are usually sampled randomly from a task distribution for an iterative model update, leading to high labeling costs and computational overhead in meta-training. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware task selection model for label efficient meta-learning. The proposed model formulates a multidimensional belief measure, which can quantify the known uncertainty and lower bound the unknown uncertainty of any given task. Our theoretical result establishes an important relationship between the conflicting belief and the incorrect belief. The theoretical result allows us to estimate the total uncertainty of a task, which provides a principled criterion for task selection. A novel multi-query task formulation is further developed to improve both the computational and labeling efficiency of meta-learning. Experiments conducted over multiple real-world few-shot image classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel framework to classify large-scale time series data with long duration. Long time series classification (L-TSC) is a challenging problem because the data often contains a large amount of irrelevant information to the classification target. The irrelevant period degrades the classification performance while the relevance is unknown to the system. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware multiple instance learning (MIL) framework to identify the most relevant period automatically. The predictive uncertainty enables designing an attention mechanism that forces the MIL model to learn from the possibly discriminant period. Moreover, the predicted uncertainty yields a principled estimator to identify whether a prediction is trustworthy or not. We further incorporate another modality to accommodate unreliable predictions by training a separate model based on its availability and conduct uncertainty aware fusion to produce the final prediction. Systematic evaluation is conducted on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, which is collected to identify and track real-world vessels. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect the types of vessels based on the trajectory and the uncertainty-aware fusion with other available data modality (Synthetic-Aperture Radar or SAR imagery is used in our experiments) can further improve the detection accuracy.},
