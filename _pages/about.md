#Existing Deep Learning models have found great success in large data regime, but many practical and real world problems are inherently limited data.
# Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm a 5th year Ph.D. Student in Computer Science working with [Prof. Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/mining/qi-yu) at  [Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing Lab, RIT](https://www.rit.edu/mining/). I completed my undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), Nepal. 

### Research
I am interested in developing trustworthy deep learning models that can learn from limited data. My research focuses on developing computationally-efficient, adversarially robust, deep learning models with accurate fine-grained uncertainty quantification capabilities, with a special focus on meta-learning models. The developed models have been successfully used for improved few-shot classification, few-shot regression, and image completion problems.

### Research Interests: 
Uncertainty Awareness, Adversarial Robustness, Meta-Learning, Transfer Learning, Multi-task Learning, Few-Shot Learning, Pattern recognition, and application of Deep Learning to real-world problems
